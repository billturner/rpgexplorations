It's been a while since I've kept up a weblog, but here I am trying it again. At least this time I have some kind of focus. I've recently become very interested in tabletop role-playing games, and specifically solo and journaling RPGs. This blog will be a record of my own explorations within the TTRPG world, both playing and creating them.

I've posted a brief introduction of how I got here, and we'll see how far we dig into this new world (to me). My goal here is to post some playthroughs of games I enjoy, as well as the progress I make while trying to create my own game. Let's see how it goes.

### About Bill

I'm a software engineer in his 50s, living in Pittsburgh, PA. I'm originally from north Texas, but I've come to love this area over the last 13 years or so. I have a wonderful wife, two outstanding kids in college (one is graduating in the spring of 2023), and a cat that does her best to feign interest in the humans that feed her.

In the last five years, I've rekindled my interest in video games, had a overly-enthusiastic fascination with modern board games (it's definitely cooled off now), and more recently, an urge to jump into role-playing games. Outside of family and various types of gaming, I'm never without a good book or two on my nightstand, and I'm starting to pick up my sketching and watercolor practice again.
