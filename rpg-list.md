title: RPGs in My Collection

Although this list will be short since I'm only beginning to delve into the world of tabletop role-playing, I'm always on the lookout for new games to add. While initially, I have more fantasy-based games, that isn't particularly my favorite.

I'll also include links to where some of the less-well known games can be found. If I have many expansions/scenarios for one particular game (looking at you **Four Against Darkness**), I may not include a full listing.
