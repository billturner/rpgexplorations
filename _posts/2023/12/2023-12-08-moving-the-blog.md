I initially set up this blog on [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) because I thought I would be posting often and could put to use many of the features that the Wordpress system allowed. However, that has not been the case. So, I'm moving this off of Wordpress and onto the VPS I host at [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/7241c814c3bc).

This will remove a monthly bill, which is nice, but I do hope I'll get to posting more in the next year. I took a bit of a break from both Dungeon23 and the TTRPGs that I had been working on, so there really wasn't much post about. I was laid off from a job several months ago, and that sort of killed any kind of motivation or inspiration I had built up. But, I started a new job a bit ago and I'm starting to get the itch to make some progress on my TTRPG projects again! So hopefully there will be some signs of life here coming soon.

I've also moved comments to Disqus, since the blog software I'm using doesn't have something built in. I'll have to see how they work out. I also have _many_ adjustments to the design I want to make, so it's going to look a little rough for the time being.
