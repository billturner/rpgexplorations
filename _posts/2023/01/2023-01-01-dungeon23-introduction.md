In [his original post](https://seanmccoy.substack.com/p/dungeon23), here's how Sean McCoy planned on creating his Dungeon23 megadungeon:

> A dungeon room a day, every day, for 2023. That’s 365 rooms. I’ll do a level a month, so 12 levels. Every week is a little area of 7 rooms, so I can keep my focus small.

That sounds like a lot of fun, but I think I'd like to try it a bit differently. If you read across Twitter, Mastodon, and Reddit how folks plan on participating, you'll find ideas like City23, World23, NPC23, and so on.

I think for my own adventure, I want to do somewhat of a combination of all of these. I'd like to start out with an overland trek (building out a region or world) and then at times either "discover" and plan out a dungeon, or maybe I'll decide to build a city instead. I think if I leave my own rules a little loose, I'll be more likely to keep up with the challenge.

I'm also not going to be terribly strict about participating every single day for the year. If I can accomplish that, then that's great. However, if I'm only able to write something down a few days a week, I'll consider that a success as well. I'm not sure how much of my progress I'll be posting to this blog, but I will try and write up at least a weekly or monthly update.

### General resources

In a short amount of time, a whole bunch of content popped up surrounding the Dungeon 23 idea. It's honestly a bit overwhelming, but there are a few sites that I do think will be an enormous help. Here are some general ones:

- [The original post](https://seanmccoy.substack.com/p/dungeon23) by Sean McCoy announcing the idea
- [https://duvelmandice.github.io/vault/](https://duvelmandice.github.io/vault/): website with a great roundup of other resources (prompts, theory, map-making tools, and much more)
- The [r/dungeon23 subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dungeon23/) with tons of posts of progress, encouragement, and even more resources

### Resources specific to my adventure

In addition to those sites listed above, here's what I think I'll be using for my own attempt. This list may get longer as I progress with my playthrough.

- [Pocket Lands (PDF)](https://02.itch.io/pocket-lands) by Alexey Aparin, along with [D100 Lands](https://www.reddit.com/r/TTRPG/comments/vb7qdo/d100lands_a_free_simple_hexcrawling_system_for/) by Evandro Novel for generating my hexcrawl overland map
- [Incompetech Hexagonal Graph Paper generator](https://incompetech.com/graphpaper/hexagonal/) for PDFs of hex graph paper
- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) for organizing and storing the writing of my adventure
- The [Four Against Darkness core rulebook](https://www.ganeshagames.net/product_info.php?cPath=1_55&products_id=295) and some of its supplemental books for monster tables, dungeon room shapes, treasures, traps, etc.
- The [D&D 5E Dungeon's Master's Guide](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/dungeon-masters-guide) for additional tables and inspiration
- More to come, I'm sure...
